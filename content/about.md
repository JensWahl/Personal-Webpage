 Welcome to my webpage! I'm Jens Christian Wahl, currently working as a research scientist at the [Norwegian Computing Center](nr.no) in the department for Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning and Image Analysis (SAMBA). This blog will mainly serve as a place where I try to present things I find interesting.
 
I finished my [master thesis](http://bora.uib.no/bitstream/handle/1956/18033/Master-Thesis---Jens-Christian-Wahl.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) in statistics in 2018, where I investigated different methods for parameter estimation of multivariate stochastic volatility. 

This webpage is written in R markdown using the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package.
